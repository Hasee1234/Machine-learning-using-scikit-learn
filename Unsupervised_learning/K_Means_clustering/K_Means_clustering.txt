in this method:the model will look all the spreadsheet and then divide the customers into groups or clusters on the base of """"PATTERNS"""like make group on base of spending normal and premium 

K_Means:means make number of clusters:like how many clusters are needed to group students in them
    example:short,medium,tall students will make clusters until all students are kept in their respective cluster
    use:in malls for customers premium or normal , students normal or brilliant

5 rule: make groups on base of height and weight of your class students on base of your observation without talking    
    1.tell number of K to machine; K is number of groups
    2.Drop 3 random points/leaders;like from where you are going to start; these are the centroids
    3.every student will choose leader/point/centroid nearest to them
    4.move the centroid/leader to centre;so leader move in
    5.repeat the steps so if you think you are in wrong leader you can change
