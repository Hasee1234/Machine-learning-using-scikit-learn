regression :tool to predicting numbers (marks on basse of study hours)
1.linear regression:find a pattern on base of study hours to predict marks like makeing a straight line  y=mx+b

"its not about the line its about the story"
"5 rows are enough fro a beginner to start"
"accuracy is not always the goal"

2.classification:machine learn from example and then classify things into groups 
in this labels are given like true or false

=>logistic regresssion=it will convert yes or no into 1 and 0 so convert into binary

=>KNN = based on your neighbouring values it will predict the result e.g;4 friends going for party so 5th will as well  slow for big data,always use odd value for k

=>decision tree : model predict on basis of asking some questions
