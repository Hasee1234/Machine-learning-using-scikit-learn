accuracy : number of correct predictions from total predictions
precison :  out of predicted values ,how many were actually positive
Recall : number of times your model is right or positive
F1 score : balamce bw precision and recall

sklearn metrics used to getaccuracy and find error
how good is model
not used for training anf testing


tips
#accuracy is not enough if your data is unbalanced
#use precision when false alarm are dangerous
#use recall when missing case is dangerous


CONFUSION MATRIX
True +ve,TN,FP,FN
if the value is more FP you are praising the fail students
if the value is more FN you are ignoring the fail students
so this table will tell you where is mistake in model

MAE  MSE   RMSE
1.Mean Absolute Error:
-take the mistake difference
-remove the minus sign
-add
-divide

2.Mean square Error:square every error and then plus and then divide by this error will look large

3.Root mean Square error : square root of Mean absolute error
